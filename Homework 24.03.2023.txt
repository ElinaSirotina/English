Rowan, I don't have the ability to access Google Docs. However, I can provide you with an example of a technical specification for a fictional project.

Background:

Our company is developing a new mobile app that will allow users to track their daily water intake. The app will provide users with reminders to drink water throughout the day, as well as track their progress towards their daily water intake goal. The app will be available for both iOS and Android devices.

Summary:

The goal of this project is to develop a mobile app that will help users stay hydrated and improve their overall health. The app will provide users with reminders to drink water throughout the day, as well as track their progress towards their daily water intake goal. The app will be simple and easy to use, with a clean and intuitive user interface.

Goals:

Develop a mobile app for iOS and Android devices that will help users track their daily water intake.
Provide users with reminders to drink water throughout the day.
Track users' progress towards their daily water intake goal.
Create a simple and intuitive user interface.
Plan:

Conduct user research to determine user needs and preferences.
Develop wireframes and prototypes to test user interface design.
Develop backend code to store user data and track progress towards daily water intake goal.
Develop frontend code for iOS and Android devices.
Test app functionality and user experience.
Optimize app performance and address any bugs or technical issues.
Launch app on App Store and Google Play Store.

Non-goals:

The app will not track any other health metrics besides water intake.
The app will not provide personalized nutrition or health advice.
Measuring impact:

Number of app downloads and user engagement.
User feedback and reviews on App Store and Google Play Store.
Number of users who meet their daily water intake goal.
This is just an example of a technical specification for a mobile app project. The actual technical specification for a project will vary depending on the specific requirements and goals of the project.
