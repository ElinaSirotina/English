Dear [team member's name],

I wanted to discuss your recent performance with you. While your work has been satisfactory, I have noticed that you have not been taking as much initiative as I would like to see. It's important that all team members take ownership of their work and actively seek out ways to contribute to the team's success.

I suggest that you take some time to reflect on ways in which you can take more ownership of your work and contribute more to our team's success. This could mean taking on additional responsibilities or proactively seeking out opportunities to improve our processes or deliverables. I am always available to discuss ideas or provide support if needed.

I want to emphasize that taking initiative is an important part of being a valued team member, and I have confidence that you can rise to this expectation. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Best regards,
Elina
