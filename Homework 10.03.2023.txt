What did you do yesterday?

Yesterday, I spent most of my time working on a new feature for our project. Specifically, I was working on the backend code to support a new user interface that our design team developed. I spent some time researching and testing different approaches to ensure that the code would be maintainable and scalable, as well as meeting the requirements of the UI. I also spent some time reviewing and commenting on my team members' code to ensure that it was up to our standards.

What problems/impediments/blockers do you have?

I'm currently facing an issue with some third-party libraries that we're using in our project. We're seeing some performance issues with these libraries, and it's causing some delays in our development. I've been working with our team lead to investigate alternative libraries that could provide the same functionality without the performance issues. I'm also working on optimizing our code to minimize the impact of these issues.

What are you doing today?

Today, I'm planning to continue working on the same feature that I was working on yesterday. Specifically, I'm going to be working on some additional functionality for the backend that will be necessary to support the UI. I'm also planning to continue collaborating with my team members to ensure that everyone is on the same page and that we're all aligned on our goals and priorities. Finally, I'm planning to spend some time researching and testing some new tools that could help us streamline our development process and improve our efficiency.
